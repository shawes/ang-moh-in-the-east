Who doesn't love a curry puff?

A staple food of my childhood back in Adelaide was a [pasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasty], and this is the closest equivalent found here in Singapore. This link to my childhood makes me try every new curry puff I stumble across (my current favourites are [Tip Top](http://www.tiptopcurrypuff.com) and [AMK puff](https://www.misstamchiak.com/amk-curry-puff/)).

I found this *"curry puff and kueh specialist"* at old airport rd, near the entrance closer to Dakota station. In the interest of my diet, I opted only for one curry puff today, so I went with curry chicken. Genie's curry puff has a thin hard outer crust, its not a fluffy & buttery pastry, making it feel less sinful. Unfortunately the puff I ate today is a bit over fried for my liking. The curry itself has a nice kick to it â€” but its not entirely memorable. The chunkiness of the curry has disappeared and it has become more a paste, and the egg was boiled so there is a rubber texture. Overall this is a satisfying curry puff (I'd choose it over old chang kee), but it did not rock my world, which I need to justify in order to eat these calories. I will have to go back and try the assorted kueh, perhaps that is their sweet spot in snacks.
