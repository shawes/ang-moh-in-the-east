I called this my new favourite shop to eat [fishball noodles]({% post_url 2020-12-09-chai-chee-fishball-noodle %}) after recently discovering it. So I had to come back and try more dishes. This time it was here quite early, before and appointment I had in chai chee. So I decided to go something clean and light for breakfast and opted for the kway teow th'ng.

Now, I have already raved about the handmade fishballs, so I won't bore you again, suffice to say it was consistent. The noodles were cooked just so, silky smooth, soft, but with enough bite. The soup was very light, not overbearing in flavour, which I prefer. Plus, you can always add fried shallots, fish sauce, or chilli etc. 

This was not a crazy blow your mind noodle soup, just a great solid bowl of noodle soup. Something I will return many times for. Plus there are no queues, I have to add half a star just for that reason alone.

**Price:** $4.00  

**Coffee shop:** Teochew kway teow fishball noodle soup  
**Address:** #01-190, 55 Chai Chee Drive  
**Hours:** 7am - 2am
