There is nothing special about this bak chor mee, it is just a good old honest meal. The epitome of comfort food. Everything is done well.

For its price it comes with generous portions of noodles, minced and sliced pork, marinated mushrooms, and pork balls. All the ingredients soaking in a nice blend of chilli and black vinegar sauce. The downside, if there is one, is that it didn't come with any liver.

A bak chor mee that's worth eating without a queue.

**Price:** $3.50  

**Coffee shop:** Kim San Leng @ Changi  
**Address:** 324 Changi Rd, Singapore 419799  
**Hours:** 9am - 8pm
