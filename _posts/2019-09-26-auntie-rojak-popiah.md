Auntie rojak is run by multiple generations of the same family, the pioneer generation couple, seemingly in their late 80s, and their daughter who helps out during peak periods. Auntie *rojak* specialises in both rojak (hence the name of the stall) and **popiah** (the uncle preps all the ingredients and sauces). The aunty at the helm is meticulous when it comes to making the **popiah**, so be prepared to wait or order extra food from another stall. However, the time it takes to wait for the popiah to be prepared is all forgiven during that first bite. The **popiah** somehow creates opposite sensations at the same time in your mouth: crunchy but delicate, a hint of spice followed by a kick of sweetness, such light skin but filling at the same time. This stall appears to have quite a following, appearing in the [paper](https://www.tnp.sg/lifestyle/makan/one-fm-food-fight-39) and other [blogs](http://islifearecipe.net/popiah-and-our-auntie-rojak/). I cannot lay claim to be a **popiah** expert in any sense of the word, but I know what I like.
