Today was one of those stinking hot days in Singapore, not a cloud in the sky, and just leaving the house makes you sweat. On days like this, Singapore desserts with shaved ice come into their own. Although dessert stalls seem to be few and far between these days. The nearest cendol to my house is at Jalan Tua Kong, so I promptly headed down there for some relief to this heat.

The first cendol I ever had was in Malacca, a city I love, so I associate it with good memories. Even if I have no idea what those little green things are. The combination of finely shaved ice with coconut cream and a sauce of gula melaka is heavenly. The red beans I could take them or leave them, I suppose it makes it more healthy. These beans had a nice bite to them. The only downside to this cendol was that its served in a cheap plastic bowl and served with a plastic spoon. Kind of takes away from the majesty of the dessert. Otherwise all I can say is wowee and eat it fast before it melts.
