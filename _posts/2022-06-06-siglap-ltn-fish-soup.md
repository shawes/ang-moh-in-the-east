Finally, there is a decent fish soup hawker in the Siglap area. It's been way too long between stalls. Sliced fish noodle soup really hits the spot on a cool (well for Singapore) rainy day.

Huang kee seafish offers the usual fresh and sliced, but what caught my eye was a 50/50. What better way to try than to risk it all and get a half-half. I opted for the small bowl at $5.50. For 50c extra I added thick bee hoon. You can choose to add your choice of rice, thin/thick bee hoon, yi mian, or mee sua to the soup.

While the price of the soup is steeper than most stalls, once your bowl is ready you understand why. The bowl is packed full of ingredients, almost too many. My soup consisted of 3 pieces of fresh batang, 3 pieces of fried, 4 lala, some chopped up fried fish cake roll, and several slices of bittergourd, tomato, and cabbage. On top sprinkled was plenty of fried garlic and fried shallots.

The soup itself has wonderful depth, without being overpowering. The flavour is not as fishy as I prefer it to be, but it does hit the spot. The batter of the fried fish is sensational, the batter is light with a salt and pepper taste. I could eat hundreds of these as a bar snack. So good.

This will quickly become a new favourite of mine, I just hope the queue doesn't get too long.

**Price:** $5.50 (+ $0.50 for noodles)
