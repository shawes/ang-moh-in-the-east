I decided to eat more chicken rice, before the [malaysian export ban](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/chicken-supply-no-panic-some-consumers-buy-extra-1907871) on chickens comes into full effect on June 1. As an *"ang moh"*, the odds of getting breast meat when you order chicken rice are extremely high. Probably the same odds of a taxi driver in Australia getting the question "Where are you from mate?". Its annoying for me, as I am not a fan of breast meat, and sometimes in the hustle and bustle of the coffee shop I forget to ask. I was also not given soup today, slightly unusual, but it was just too hot to complain today.

The chicken is perfectly poached, strangely for breast meat it melted in your mouth, was not dry at all. I try and avoid eating too much of the skin, but when its this flavoursome, it takes a lot of willpower to pass it up. The rice is bursting with chicken stock flavour and each grain is separated â€” an important texture component for me. The chilli sauce is good, nothing exceptional, but it does the job. I admit I do miss the garlic sauce.

Easily one of the better chicken rices in the neighbourhood.

**Price:** $4.00  

**Coffee shop:** Soy eu tua  
**Address:** 15 Upper East Coast Rd, Siglap  
**Hours:** 7:00am - 3:00pm (closed mondays)
