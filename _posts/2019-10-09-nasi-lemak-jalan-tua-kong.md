Hands down, (and despite appearances) this is the best **nasi lemak** I have ever eaten. There I said it.

*(Caveated that I have never tried any of the famous ones - I'm just not going to queue for **nasi lemak**. Period.)*

<mark style="background-color: lightblue">There are only three variables worth worrying about in a **nasi lemak**, the chicken wing, the sambal, and the rice.</mark> This dish has each of them covered. The chicken wing is fried fresh, marinated in what appears to be some cornflour and tumeric — juicy, crunchy, and bursting with flavour all at the same time. The sambal, while more medium than hot, has that sweet, salty, and spicy goodness I want for my breakfast. And the rice? Its sinful. I can only think [coconut cream](https://www.thekitchn.com/whats-the-difference-coconut-m-75446) could make it this lemak. This is not a **nasi lemak** you can eat everyday unless you have some miracle metabolism, but it is a **nasi lemak** you *want* to eat everyday.

*P.S.* Nor's stop serving the **nasi lemak** sometime in the morning — I got rejected at 10am the first time I wanted to try it. Today I managed to get it at 9am, but as you can see from the photo the peanuts and cucumber had already run out.

*P.P.S.* If you have space afterwards, I suggest trying their [kueh lopis](https://www.mykeuken.com/2013/09/glutinous-rice-with-dark-brown-sugar.html)!

**Coffee shop:** Soy Eu Tua Kopitiam
