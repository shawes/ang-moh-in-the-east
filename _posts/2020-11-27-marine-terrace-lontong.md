I found myself down the wet market earlier than usual as I was out of coffee beans and caffeine is not negotiable in my morning routine. Marine terrace wet market has an uncle selling roasted coffee beans (sans margarine and sugar) for $15/kg. The cheapest beans I've found in Singapore by a long way and robusta beans are more forgiving with quality and make for a great ristretto.

Leaving this early meant I had a chance to buy some breakfast. Normally I do not get here so early and half the food stalls adjacent to the market are already closed for the day. Mornings are not my thing. So I decided to try one of the stalls I usually only see shutters on. I walked past a table with a couple eating what looked like a creamy laksa almost, topped with an hard boiled egg. I knew when I saw it that I must have try it. Using the power of deduction (I saw someone else order it) I realised it was the **lontong** from the Warung Wak Nakem stall. As luck would have it, as I patiently queuing, I was rewarded with a fresh batch of begedil.

**Lontong** feels to me like healthier version of laksa, the coconut broth itself is lighter making it more suitable for a breakfast meal (I don't know about the calories). The rice cakes (*nasi impit*) were somehow surprisingly tasty, often the ones served with satay I have had around Singapore have been as bland as cardboard. The highlight of this dish is the sambal and the fried spicy shredded coconut (*serunding kelapa*), mixing it all in, and combining with the tofu, egg, rice cakes, and cabbage, makes for a heavenly breakfast. The cherry on top was the begedil, nicely spiced and a hint of onion - potato is comfort food in every culture. The hawker also placed it neatly on the side of the **lontong** so it was still nice and crispy. I've never understood dropping these crisp parcels of bursting goodness into a piping hot bowl of soto ayam and making them soggy dumplings &#x1F627;

This breakfast **lontong** was good enough for me to consider becoming a morning person. I cannot recommend it enough.

**Price:** $3.00 with an extra $0.50 for the begedil  

**Coffee shop:** Marine Terrace Market and Food Centre  
**Address:** Block 50A Marine Terrace  
**Hours:** 7am - sells out
