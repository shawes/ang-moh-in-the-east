Today I was a bit under the weather, dealing with an infected tooth. So I went out in search of something nourishing. Turns out at 3pm, there are limited options at the Marine Terrace hawker centre. Of the four stalls open, some sliced fish soup seemed to be the best choice for my immune system. I normally only order the bak chor mee at this stall, but hey variety is the spice of life. Ordering here is a unique system, you queue on the left of the stall to order and pay and then queue on the right side of the stall to collect. 

My first impression is the soup is devine. I could drink this all day. The combination of sliced tomato, soft tofu, iceberg lettuce, and seaweed is a winner. The dish is bursting with flavour, in fact I'd probably have it without the fish. The fish used in the soup is [batang *(Scomberomorus commerson)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow-barred_Spanish_mackerel), which is not my favourite. I end up eating all the slices of fish, but the last couple were a struggle due to the strong fishy taste and slippery texture. 

The broth is definitely the star of this dish.

**Hawker centre:** Marine Terrace Market and Food Centre  
**Address:** Block 50A Marine Terrace, #01-277
