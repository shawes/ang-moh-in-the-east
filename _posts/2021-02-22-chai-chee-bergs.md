It was a burger kind of day. I didn't know of any half-decent burgers\* under $20 in the area. Google informed me that there was a burger behind Decathlon at chai chee industrial park. While not strictly a coffee shop, the foodcourt feels like one. I must say it was not so easy to find, you had to go to the building behind and traverse it to a far flung corner. This pandemic closing all but one entrance to the building adds to the confusion.

The first thing you notice about this burger is the price. $6 for a handmade beef patty is on point. Has to be one of, if not the, best priced burger in town.

First time here, so I went with the classic cheeseburger. It comes with a single patty (you can upsize) and cheese, along with a local twist of fried shallots and picked green chilli. The first thing you notice is the burger bun, with a "B" burnt into it, the bun itself is soft and sweet.

The patty is cooked medium-rare and the meat juices combined with the sauce and cheese is heavenly. The local twist I could have swapped out for a proper pickle, but I appreciate the choice to get a signature. The only let down was the fries, which had been cooked to within an inch of their life and maybe frozen too long as well. I'd prefer the burger came without them tbh and just offered as a side. Best burger in the east? For burgers under $10? Its easily the best.

\*Disclaimer: I need to have *at least* 6 beers under my belt before I can stomach McDonalds or Burger King.
