After cycling at east coast park, along with seemingly half of singapore, a refreshing [beer at east coast lagoon]({% post_url 2019-09-25-yi-fa-hot-cold-drinks %}) is always on the cards. Today I also felt a bit peckish, so out of laziness from tired cycling legs, I decided to try the stall closest to my table, which happened to be Siam Thai Kitchen.

I find it difficult eating thai food by myself, like zi char, most dishes seem to be made to be only part of an overall meal. The choices then come down to rice or noodles, so I settled on a noodle dish, the "thai style" beef hor fun.

What came out was a pleasant surprise, essentially beef [pad see ew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pad_see_ew), a favourite from my days of eating cheap thai food in Sydney. The hor fun, even though fried on a wok, remained silky and slurpable. The *wok hei* was impressive, imparting smokey notes throughout the dish. The beef had been tenderised and was decent enough quality for a hawker. The sauce imparted a lingering residual sweetness, which was offset by the acidity of the lime [a proper sour lime too, not calamansi](https://jaffajuice.net/pages/calamansi-vs-lime-whats-the-diffence). I had to add some chilli from the condiments selection to give it a bit more of a kick. Overall this dish was a winner.

**Price:** $5.00  

**Hawker centre:** East coast lagoon food village  
**Address:** #01-27, 1220 East coast parkway  
**Hours:** 11:00am - 10:30pm
