If you find yourself at east coast lagoon food centre on a weekday during the day, you will notice that this teochew braised duck stall is insanely popular, in fact it will be the only one with a queue. I'm not a queuer, so on this day when I saw the line down to one person, I jumped at the opportunity to see what all the fuss was about.

I'm not going to lie. I was a little underwhelmed. Sure the duck was extremely tender and not fatty, but it just didn't float my boat. The sauce was a little vinegary for my liking. The rice was pretty standard fair. The soup was underwhelming. Maybe I'm just not a fan of braised duck in general. I certainly do not see why the queue is so long, but there must be something here that I am missing. I did not order the correct dish perhaps? I could see with a few friends, some beers, and half a duck, that this could be a winner.

**Price:** $4.70 (including braised egg)  

**Hawker centre:** East coast lagoon food village  
**Address:** #01-29, 1220 East Coast Park Service Road, 468960  
**Hours:** 11am - 7:30pm (or until sold out)
