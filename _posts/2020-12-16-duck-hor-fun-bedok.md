There is something about **duck**. The perfect combination of moistness, fattiness, and flavour â€” it hits chicken for [six](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFxtGIrJtL4). This is a coffee shop I was just walking past as I was lost trying to find a POSB ATM in bedok town centre. To calm my frustrations I decided to have some **duck**, a comfort meal.

I chose to get the **duck** with hor fun. The amount of duck is generous for the price, often hawkers get a bit stingy with **duck** meat. I was given a lot of breast meat, with only a nice small amount of fat between the meat and the skin. The meat was everything I wanted it to be, tender, juicy, flavoursome. The hor fun was passable, nothing special, it wasn't from Ipoh.  

Did I mention the **duck**? 

**Price:** $3.80

**Coffee shop:** BD 211 Food House  
**Address:** #01-763, 211 New Upper Changi Rd  
**Hours:** 9am - 9pm
