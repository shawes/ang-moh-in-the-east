This is one of the first stalls I ever patronised as a tourist in Singapore. Back then they were located in the jago close kopitiam, before it was called Brunners. The old owner back then was so cheap he would turn the power off between lunch and dinner. Lights and fans came on only if customers arrived, leaving the hawkers to swelter in the heat. The uncle always stood out because he would always be dressed immaculately in his chef's uniform. Not a common sight behind a hawker stall and I appreciate his dedication to the threads.

One chinese new year I came back and their stall at jago close had closed. Using some internet sleuthing led me to find them located at a food court in industrial park in chai chee. Since them I have followed them to marine terrace and now lagoon hawker centre.

Siang yuen is a husband and wife team, Joe and Pauline, he roasts the meats, she takes the orders. What sets Siang yuen apart from many other roast meats stalls is that they still roast their meats using the traditional charcoal fired method. The taste of the charcoal meat is always superior to gas, but it takes more effort, hence is it seen less and less these days.

Joe's skill means the skin on his duck is always super crispy, just how I like it. The meat is flavoursome and juicy - but hey duck is duck, hard to go wrong. While the amount of duck you get makes it on the pricier side, you are paying for tradition. The roasted duck came with some achar on the side also, which was top notch. Spicy, sweet, and sour all at the same time â€” I will admit I am a pickle affectionado.
