There have been many words written on the laksa wars of katong ([here](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/5-famous-singapore-food-feuds-0), [here](https://live2makan.com/2018/09/17/the-laksa-war/), and my favourite [here](https://johorkaki.blogspot.com/2020/01/a-history-of-singapore-katong-laksa.html)). I am fascinated by the history of the hawkers and their stories. I have previously reviewed one of the roxy [laksa]({% post_url 2021-04-03-changi-rd-katong-laksa %})

So it seems this stall in roxy square, Janggut Laksa, was started by the niece of the original Janggut, Mr Ng Juat Swee. It follows what I expect of katong laksa, the cut thick bee hoon noodles, fish cakes, prawns, beansprouts, blood cockles, with chilli and laksa leaf. What stands this laksa apart is the laksa broth. The soup has chunks in it, mix of what seems like curdled coconut milk and rempah. I personally love this soup, but I think it is quite rich. A dish you might not want to eat if you are dieting — cheat day perhaps. The chili sauce is hot too, it makes a few beads of sweat drip down my temple even though I am in air-conditioned comfort. There is also something comforting about being able to eat a noodle soup with only a spoon.

**Price:** $5.00
