Vietnamese food is probably the most popular south-east asian food in Australia these days, more popular now I believe than Thai or Cantonese, and infinitely more well-known than Singapore-Malaysian-Indonesian food. My staple at university was **banh mi**, tied with a [meat pie](https://www.vilis.com) as the only filling lunch you can get in Australia these days and get change from $5. So naturally I was excited when I read in the paper [a new banh mi store](https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/food/cheap-good-simple-but-thoughtfully-made-banh-mi) had opened at Haig Rd market. Having tried some of the chain stores in shopping malls, so far my **banh mi** experiences in sg have been disappointing to say the least. Considering the **banh mi** maker (sandwich artist?), Miss Kim Phung, was from Vietnam raised my expectations, even if the straits times article wasn't 100% onboard.

Well yeah, sadly, it was just ok to my tastes. It had all the ingredients and they were arranged in the correct order, it just didn't mesh. **Banh mi** done well is an irresistible sandwich, something from the gods. This one? Well it didn't leave me clamouring for more, just longing for the **banh mi** I knew and loved from Sydney and Saigon. Saying that, I'm not adverse to trying it again sometime in the future. The roll itself was the best part, a nice light crusty bread, and I always do have a craving for a sandwich.

**Price:** $4.50  

**Hawker Centre:** Haig Road Market And Food Centre  
**Address:** #01-53, 14 Haig Rd  
**Hours:** 7.30am - 7.00pm (daily)
