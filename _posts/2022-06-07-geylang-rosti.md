I've never met anyone that doesn't appreciate rosti. Potatoes and butter fried in a pan. What is there not to like? I was not expecting to see it served in a coffee shop though, especially in Geylang. I think this will be the new trend of hawkers, for better or worse. The next generation will cook the food that they both like and think will sell and they are only limited by their imagination, not recipes passed down through generations. I predict coffee shops will mixes of independent stalls like Spud's shack and then chains/franchises serving more traditional hawker food. The older generation hawkers sadly only have maybe 10 years left before they become rare finds.

I ordered the original rosti, which comes with a fried egg. There are other variations and flavours (seaweed, cajun, etc). Admittedly this rosti is not much to look at on the plate. However, it makes up for it with flavour. Cripsy on the outside and fluffy buttery potato on the inside. Its a great breakfast. The dollop of sour cream was a nice extra. I could have gone without the sunnyside egg, but the yolk was deliciously runny.

Come here to try a rosti at a price only a fraction a hipster cafe would charge you.

**Price:** $5.00  

**Coffee shop:** Fellascube
**Address:** 440 Geylang Road, S389400
**Hours:** 11am - 10pm (closed thursday)
