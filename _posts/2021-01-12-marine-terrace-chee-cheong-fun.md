I was introduced to chee cheong fun when I was living in Sydney, [yum cha](https://www.broadsheet.com.au/sydney/guides/best-yum-cha) was an almost weekly ritual for my wife and I. That [sydney cantonese style](https://images.app.goo.gl/GncSD8vjZLtq2jAZ9) chee cheong fun was more of a thick noodle, wrapping a few prawns and garlic, covered in that signature thin sweet soy & sesame oil sauce.

The next style I tried was the [penang style](https://images.app.goo.gl/44JbbyKKBquW9RneA) chee cheong fun, where the rice noodle is rolled up, cut into segments and served with almost a hoi son sauce and sesame seeds.

This chee cheong fun is more like the Sydney style, but still different. The highlight is the rice noodle. The noodles are soft, silky, and delicate. You almost don't even feel you are eating them, instead they magically slide down your throat, aided by the sweet sauce. I chose the vegetable filling, opting for a cleansing breakfast. The vegetables turned out to be shredded iceberg lettuce. Delicious none the less. The chilli is quite pungent and you have to be careful with its spice power. To be honest I would prefer some chiu chow chili oil with this, but the chili paste they have here also works. The dish is topped off with some pickled vegetables, which lift the flavour of everything.

This is definitely a must try dish, I have not seen chee cheong fun anywhere else like this in Singapore so far.
