*Enter the chicken rice.* I always thought chicken rice was something that was hard to make really special. I was wrong. This chicken rice is special. The price, at $5.50, seems high initially, however, it comes with a generous amount of...well everything. Including all you can eat achar, self service from a jar on the counter.

*The way of the chicken rice*. The chicken comes on a bed of crunchy bean sprouts, I feel like I am in Ipoh. To top it off the entire dish is garnished with crunchy fried garlic bits. Today I was late, so there was only roasted chicken left, but the skin was still wonderfully crispy, the portion size generous, and the chicken itself was tender and juicy. The texture and flavour of the rice is amazing, I could eat a mountain of this rice.

*Be soup*. The soup was a hearty western style chicken soup with a carrot and celery base. The sort of soup you crave when you are home sick with a cold (or COVID if you can still taste).

*Meal of death*. The braised egg provided the protein requirements I needed. Cleanse the palate with some achar. Meal complete.

**Price:** $5.50 (+ 50c for braised egg)
