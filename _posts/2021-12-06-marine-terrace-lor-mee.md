This was my first time eating out post-COVID isolation. Emerging from being locked in a bedroom and into the hustle and bustle of as hawker centre was quite a difference. The sounds and smells can be over-stimulating for the newly released.

A new day, means a new stall. Today, I chose a stall I hadn't seen before, lor mee seller. To be honest I am not sure if this stall is part of the carrot cake offerings or a side business of its own and sub-renting the space of xing long cooked food. However, the signage made it exciting enough to try.

I ordered a $4 bowl, thinking it would be good for a small breakfast. Instead this huge bowl of lor mee was presented to me. They do not skimp on the ingredients here. The visual presentation is good, the highlight being the huge pieces of fried fish skin sticking out of the thick & gooey black broth.

The stall has self-service condiments, that I must admit feels weird in these pandemic times. You can add your own toppings of black vinegar, minced garlic, and chilli.

The fried fish was cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside and tender in the middle. I could taste the fish in every bite (and not just the oil like some places). The fish contrasted textures nicely with the fried fish skin, also a good use of the whole fish. There braised egg was there for some extra protein. The let down, not in flavour but in texture was the pork belly, which was still a little bit tough. Some bean sprouts to make you feel healthier.

The soup has a lot of complexity, I may have put a bit too much vinegar in to truly appreciate it. The soup was thick, without being too starchy and it coated the noodles with flavour. I don't know why you only ever see these thick yellow flat noodles in lor mee, but I love them. Chewy and satisfying. I would like to try them fried.

A stall worth trying for that satisfying trinity of pork, vinegar, and garlic goodness.
