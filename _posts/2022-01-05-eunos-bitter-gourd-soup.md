I don't have much to say about this soup. It's simple. It's delicious. It's as healthy as a hawker dish can be. You have to be a fan of bitter gourd to appreciate it. The portions are generous. The soup has the nice hint of fried garlic, with little parcels of salty fried fish. The pork has been sliced super thinly as to illuminate its sweetness. It comes with a generous side of rice to fill you up on carbs if keto is not your thing.

I could eat this soup every day.
