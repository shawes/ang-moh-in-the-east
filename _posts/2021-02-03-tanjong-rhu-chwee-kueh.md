In an effort to lose some extra kilos before CNY, I went cycling on Saturday along the east coast park connector, which led me one way or another to ending up around Tanjong Rhu. It was a strange day, it felt like a ghost down around lunchtime. I've never seen a HDB estate feel so empty during the day. I wonder if I was missing something.

Walking around the Jalan Batu hawker centre, there weren't too many options left. The one that stood out was Ah Ma's chwee kueh, because, well it was open. Normally something I would eat for breakfast, but beggars can't be choosers. The price of $2 for 5 is also hard to beat.

The chwee kueh is soft and silky. Each bite seems to disappear down your throat before you know whats happening. The uncle is also amazingly generous with the pickled radish (cai poh), not too salty and not too sour. The cai poh is really the flavour of the dish, so it needs to be good quality. The chilli sauce is quite savoury, which I prefer. Robust and hearty, but does not overpower the flavour of the radish with too much heat.

I'm jealous of the residents of Jalan Batu, who can eat this every morning if they so choose.

**Price:** $2.00 (for 5 pieces)
