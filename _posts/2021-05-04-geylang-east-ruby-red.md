I'm not normally one for desserts, but this was another stinking hot day. I was not the only one with the same idea either. This stall doesn't make it easy to choose. There are 24 desserts to choose from on the menu. I have a fondness for the colour red and for coconut milk, so red rubies seemed like the perfect choice for me. The shaved ice with coconut milk was decadent. This is a not a dessert for those counting their calories. The crunchy little red "rubies" were also tasty, little jellies with a crunch inside. Googling them, apparently its water chestnut in red tapioca jelly. I would have never guessed tbh. Wouldn't be a proper asian dessert if they didn't put some exotic fruit or beans in there I suppose...

This is one of the most refreshing asian desserts I have ever had. I was a little amazed I had never tried it before.
