I always get excited when I see kolo mee ([here]({% post_url 2019-10-06-kolo-mee-yun-xiang %}) and [here]({% post_url 2020-12-31-haig-rd-kolo-mee %})), one of my favourite south-east asian dishes. It's the king of noodle dishes.

The noodles here are yum, cooked so they have a perfect bite to them and thoroughly coated in the shallot flavoured oil. The rest of the sauce are perhaps a bit weaker, its lacking that punch I expect from kolo mee. The char siew was a too sweet for my tastes, but the cuts are generous. Its still not quite what I fondly remember about the Sarawak kolo mee, but its getting mighty close. The price of $5 is a bit steep - perhaps the noodles are more expensive than most? I'm not sure.

I will come back to try the laksa, their signature dish.

**Price:** $5.00  

**Coffee shop:**  Shi Wei Tian Kopitiam  
**Address:** Blk 204 Bedok North Street 1, 460204  
**Hours:** 9am - 7pm (closed Mondays)
