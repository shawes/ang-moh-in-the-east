The hard working old couple running this stall appear to have not upped their prices since maybe the late 90s, a bowl of wanton mee for $3 seems like a relic of the distant past. Also old school is the setup of the stall whereby the uncle cooks the noodles while facing you. I quite like this interaction you can have while he is cooking, it also lets you observe the craft.

The bowl of wanton mee is a decent portion. The noodles in this wanton mee are not my preferred style, but they are cooked to perfection. Each mouthful is chewy and springy, and the individual strands are coated nicely by the sauce. The char siew is juicy and tender, and cut up into bite sized pieces that blend it more into the overall dish. They stallholders are also generous with the amount of pork fat added to the dish, each piece is delightfully crunchy.

The chilli sauce is strong, perhaps too strong for my tastes. By the time I got around to trying the soup and the wantons, my taste buds were on fire. Visually, they both seemed nice, but I might as well have had COVID, couldn't taste a thing.
