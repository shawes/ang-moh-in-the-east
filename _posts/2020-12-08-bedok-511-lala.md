Today I was meeting an old friend for beers. He has a lot of free time on his hands since the government scheduled renovations for the hawker centre where his shop is [located]({% post_url 2019-09-25-yi-fa-hot-cold-drinks %}). He suggested we meet at Kaki Bukit 511 food centre, close to his house, and incidently one of my favourite pre-COVID supper places in Singapore. As we were working on the bucket of beers, I decided to get some snacks, and being lazy choose something from the closest stall. I went with the **lala**, one of my all-time favourite drinking dishes, even if it is always overpriced. Little individual portions so it keeps the conversation going, and enough spice to keep the beers flowing. The advertised **lala** dish was very descriptive, adding to the intrigue.

This was a style I first tried in Malacca from a street vendor off Jonker St. I instantly fell in love with the flavour, ordering it whenever [I see it](/_posts/2020-11-20-frankel-crab-beehoon.md). The combination of the curry leaves, fried garlic, and chili, combined with the slight saltiness of the **lala** is a truly destination flavour. Luckily this dish was no exception, in fact I'd go as far as saying it was the best sauce of this kind I have had outside of that street vendor in Malacca. I should caveat I was a couple of Carlsbergs in while eating this dish. The **lala** were cooked perfectly, the texture chewy but not rubbery. A dish definitely worth trying if you find yourself at the 511 market as I did.

**Price:** $10.00  

**Hawker centre:** Kaki Bukit 511 Market & Food Centre  
**Address:** Blk 511 Bedok North Street 3  
**Hours:** 5pm - late
