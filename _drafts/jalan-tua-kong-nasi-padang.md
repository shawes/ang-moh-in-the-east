$4. Vege curry . Bitter gourd. cabbage. Beansporut

Vege curry soft like Ponting curry. Coconut milk. 

Cabbage had this flavour. Maybe dried shrimp? Was delicious. And not too oily 

Bittergourd was more bitter gourd than egg. Which I like 

Beansporuts needed the sambal. But still retained their crunch
