I get intimidated in nasi padang or cai fan stalls. The main reason is that I do not know the names of many (any?) of the dishes. It makes me feel a bit stupid just pointing at dishes I can only often guess what they are. A language barrier or more likely time pressures in the growing queue behind me, don't give the server time to explain the nuance of every cooked dish on display. Why can't there be little signs in front of each dish for an ignoramus like me?

Today there was no queue, so I felt brave from the get go. Also I had decided on a meat free day, so that reduced the number of options from the nasi padang to try.

I chose a vegetarian curry, which was a sayur lodeh type of dish. I chose the bitter gourd stir-fried with egg. I chose another cabbage option that was cooked with dried shrimp. I chose a bean sprout dish with salted fish. To top it off I ordered a begedil. Admittedly deciding to go vegetarian meant I left a lot of good looking curries and rendangs on the table.

I didn't realise how cost effective nasi padang would be. The first time I ever ordered it I went with a lot of seafood options and the price was over $20??! This time I got 4 vegetarian dishes, rice, and a begedil for $4. What a steal.

Everything was nice, especially the begedil. Except I guess it is not freshly cooked, so the vegetables feel a bit wilted. Surprisingly it was not oily either. I felt really healthy after eating it all. So healthy in fact, I got myself a [chendol]({% post_url 2021-04-28-jalan-tua-kong-chendol %}) from the stall next door.
