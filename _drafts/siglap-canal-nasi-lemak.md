Nasi lemak is possibly my favourite breakfast, though there are limited decent options around me in the east. Breakfast food needs to be close to home. There is something about the combination of flavour and textures of the dish that is so appealing. The dish also feels light, which makes it a good way to start the day. 

Madas nasi lemak is a new stall open in Siglap, along with the more atas [Coconut Club](link) on Frankel ave, that is creating a nasi lemak revival? [Noor's padang](link) at Jalan Tua Kong is great, but getting a seat in that coffee shop is not always the easiest there and the morning sun can be brutal. 

Madas nasi lemak has opened near Siglap Centre in what I call the stall of death. It is the very end stall near the drinks station, which has seen a revolving array of tenants due to the hard to notice aspect of it. However, when I was there the stall was heavily populated by delivery drivers waiting for multiple orders, so lets hope they can buck the trend. 

First impressions are that the nasi lemak is not cheap. Most options are north of $4.50. And not priced in ringgit. My favourite is the ikan kuning set, so I went with this option at $4.70. The presentation itself is cool, if not so good for the environment in a disposable basket but with sexy heavily weighted cutlery. 

For $4.70 I got 3 pieces of ikan kuning, so I felt less ripped off. The rice is less lemak than I prefer, but retains the nice coconut taste. The fish was a bit dry, but had the lovely salty tumeric taste I crave for breakfast. I prefer it fried a bit more so the bones are a softer as I'm too lazy to pick off the meat. 

They roast their own peanuts in this fancy contraption and oh how it pays off. The peanuts could be a side dish by themselves. I want more. For the price I'd prefer a runny egg, but at leats it wasn't too oily. The sambal was the biggest let down, but oomph, mostly tomato sauce tasting. I'm after sambal to wake me up from my slumber with that chilli kick (I'm not a morning person). 

It's a decent nasi lemak that's worth a try, but I will keep searching for the one that delivers everything that I want.
