The hard working old couple running this stall appear to have not upped their prices since maybe the late 90s, $3 wanton mee seems like a relic of the past.

The noodles are not my preferred style of noodle, but they are cooked to perfection. Each mouthful is chewy and springy, and the individual strands are coated by the sauce.

The char siew is juicy and tender. It is cut up into bite sized pieces, which mak it blend up into the overall dish.

The wonderful goodness of pork crackling.

The chili is strong, perhaps too strong. By the time I got to the soup and the wantons, all I could taste was the chilli sauce. They both seemed nice, but I could not really taste it.
