Koo Kee Set Meal

Kang kong with a sesame sauce - hard to eat with a beard 
Noodles so simple but so delicious 
Soup is amazing. Clean bit flavoursome 
5 pieces in yong tau foo
- one fishpaste fried tofu (salty)
- Tofu is nice and soft 
- Pork fried tofu thing was a bit chewy
- Fish ball had a great bitey texture 
- Last one was a tofu pocket with fish paste , soaked up the soup 


Chili sauce is spicy, but earthy
Hoisin sauce
