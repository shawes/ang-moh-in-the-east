I first heard of the dish _lei cha_ in Sarawak where there is a large Hakka population. I did not see the dish, but read about it on a random blog about things to eat in Kuching. I kept my eye open for hawkers selling _lei cha_ but never came across any in the parts of town I visited. Upon returning to Singapore, I was determined to taste this dish, based on the photos I had seen of this strange green soup, accompanied with a bimimbap like collection of vegetables and protein.

The lei cha itself is a ground tea made primarily from tea leaves, mixed with other herbs, nuts, and seeds. These are all pounded using a mortar and pestle until the a thick paste texture is achieved. A detailed description of the process can be seen in Netflix's Flavourful Origins (https://www.netflix.com/sg/title/80991060).

Hot water is mixed with the lei cha to create a soup, and it is accompained by a bowl of vegetables and rice. My preference is to mix the soup into the bowl of vegetables.
