A new stall thai opened up at marine terrace, I did a double take, because the previous stall was also thai, but this stall focuses specifically on khao kha moo. Perhaps the same tenants, but with a menu pivot. I was enticed by the large pot of pork knuckle in soup that was visible from the window. The wafting aroma of the pork was enough to get me salivating. It was 10:30am, that no where zone between breakfast and lunch, but I just had to try this.

I went with the pork knuckle hor fun.

The broth reminds be a bit of BKT, but sweeter. You can take the five spice, star anise, and cinnamon. 

pickled green mustard and a slightly vinegary chilli sauce
