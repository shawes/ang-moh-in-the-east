Song kee's fishball noodles caused my first **wow** moment in Singapore. After that first bite into a fishball, I had to stop masticating, pause, and reflect on how insanely good this tasted.  

Let me explain.  

In Australia, fishballs are commonly found in asian supermarkets, but I had never encountered them in a restaurant setting. When I had encountered fishballs, e.g. at hotpot dinner parties, I was not particularly enamoured with either the taste or the texture — I readily admit to an aversion to processed foods (don't get me started on spam fries). However, this indifference to fishballs was instantly changed upon tasting my first handmade one. The texture was springy, but surpsingly soft once the fishball was pierced with a bite. The proteins could be made out as you chewed, bursting with flavour at each bite. These fishballs were a million miles away from their smooth and spongy factory cousins I had first encountered in a hotpot. The **fishy** taste was even minimised in these handmade fishballs — I would be interested to know if this is due to the type of fish used, but the species name is not made available.

Each bowl comes with a combination of fishballs, tofu stuffed with fish paste, fish dumplings and fish rolls — how many is dependent on the price of the bowl. The fish dumplings seem to be the highlight of the bowl here, I have noticed several customers asking for extra ones when ordering. You can choose from a soup or dry noodle, a variety of noodles, and three sizes of dishes. So far I have only tried the dry noodles, with either mee pok (flat egg noodle) or mee kia (skinny egg noodle). The noodles are not going to set records, but they were never supposed to be the star of the dish.

It can be hard to differentiate between fishball noodles sellers, therefore the quality of the chilli sauce becomes critical in determine your favourite bowls. The noodles must be tossed in a good amount of chilli, deep fried pork fat, and some lard. A good bowl of fishball noodles is not necessarily a health concious choice, but you cannot skimp on flavour. At song kee, the chilli has a decent kick, and the pork fat serving is generous. Those random crunches when eating the noodles, the explosion of salty porky goodness, are what bring a smile to the face. I suggest you add a good dash of the black vinegar (they even offer balsamic) to the bowl for an increased mouth watering experience.

If you have not yet tried Song kee fishball noodle, then drop everything and do it today. So far from what I have tasted in the east, they are the kings. The only negative is they do not serve beer.  

**Price:** $4.00 (I suggest ordering the $6 for more variety of ingredients)
