# Fishball noodles

This was the very first dish I fell in love with in Singapore. Completely different from anything I had ever tasted in Australia. The noodles—usually I choose mee pok dry—are cooked al dente and then tossed in rendered pork fat. Sensational.

While fishballs are common in asian supermarkets in Australia, I had never encountered them in a restaurant setting. I can't say I fell in love with the texture and often taste of fishballs. I've never been a fan of processed foodstuffs. However, my indifference to fishballs changed once I had my first handmade fishball. Now here was a texture that was unbelievably nice. Instead of being smooth and spongy, handmade fishballs have this spring and bite to them and they do not tear neatly in the mouth as you chew the ball. Flavour oozes out during each bite and rarely do you seem to get the strong fish taste that can occur with their factory cousins.

Although for me, what really separates the quality of fishball noodle sellers is their chilli. For dry fishball noodles, the mee needs to be tossed in a combination of the pork fat and a chilli. The chilli needs to coat the noodles and have a depth that can cut through the taste of the fish, but at the same time not over power it the entire dish.
