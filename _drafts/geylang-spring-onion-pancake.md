Shallot pancake $1.80
Soya bean drink $1.70

Pancake was dough and felt undercooked. Also stinged on the shallots. Is this how itâ€™s supposed

To be in Taiwan? Chewy instead of crispy?
Crispy at the edges

Soya milk is ok . Not amazing. Not too sweet and order cold comes with no ice. I also hate the plastic mugs.
