I don't often venture into Dunman Food Centre, the building is not exactly welcoming with its enclosed eating space. And in these pandemic times every second table seems to be a *no sitting zone*, making it hard to find a place to makan during peak periods. So when I do, I try and eat something new. Today in the back right corner of the bottom level I noticed something I have never seen being sold before. Pockets of deep fried tofu, stuffed with a sort of rojack looking mixture. I was intrigued and bought one to sample.

Turns out I was half correct. It was a fried tofu pocket, but stuffed with a chopped medley of hard boiled egg, fish cake, either fried yam or carrot cake, and some cucumber. It is a nice combination, but one was enough for me. I felt couldn't appreciate the combination of competing flavours, it was a bit overwhelming.

The highlight for mine was their chilli sauce. A delicious mix of spice, sweet, and sour. Runny enough to liberally pour over the meal, but thick enough to stick to the ingredients. I would buy bottles of this if I could.

I will comeback to eat just because of the uniqueness of this dish.
