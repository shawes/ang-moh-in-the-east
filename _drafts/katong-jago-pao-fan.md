Another rainy day over the easter weekend found me down at [Brunner's coffee shop](https://www.facebook.com/Brunners-Coffeeshop-FB-189197318523252/) at Katong. Torrential rain meant I was going to be stuck here for the foreseeable future. Normally I only frequent this coffee shop at night time, so I was intrigued as to what the lunch options were. The first thing I saw was the specials offered by the zhi char, pao fan, what could be better for a cold rainy day? A dish that is making a comeback in Singapore (apparently)[https://www.straitstimes.com/life/food/pao-fan-fever-is-on-in-singapore-with-new-entrants-targeting-the-mass-market]. The pao fan came with different options, fish, lala, prawns, or combination of all three. I opted for just the pao fan with just the fish.

Th 

Soup is amazing . So complex. Itâ€™s of fish stock. Can taste the ginger.thickened with some evaporated milk perhaps . Served piping hot

Crispy bits of garlic 

Rice is somehow soft but crunchy at the same (well has bite)

Generous amount of batang . Not fishy at all, even the bits near the stomach. 

Special . $6. 

The sambal belachan is perhaps too much belachan , not enough chili. Definitely not hand pounded . 
Green chilies are nice. Very sweet.
Perfect rainy day food.
