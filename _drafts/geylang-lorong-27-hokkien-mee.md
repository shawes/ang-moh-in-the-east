I have always wanted to go to this coffee shop after seeing it on Parts Unknown with the late [Anthony Bourdain](https://explorepartsunknown.com/singapore/eat-like-bourdain/). While he didn't eat the **hokkien mee**, I was intrigued as I live close to the *Lorong 29 Hokkien Mee* on east coast road run by Alex See and had read that this stall was run by his [younger brother Hock Siong](https://www.8days.sg/eatanddrink/newsandopening/the-millennial-hawkers-who-help-fry-geylang-lor-29-hokkien-mee-s-13115618). If this **hokkien mee** was anywhere near as good as the one on east coast rd, then I would be in for a treat.

Both these stalls cook their dishes the old fashioned way using charcoal, although unlike the east coast stall, this **hokkien mee** is cooked one plate at a time.

**Price:** $6.00  

**Coffee shop:** Lor 29 Xing Lian Eating House (since 1954)  
**Address:** 549 Geylang Rd  
**Hours:** 4:30pm - 11:00pm (closed on wednesdays)
