Asked if want vegetarian or normal. Normal is fried prawns. Extra umami and saltiness. 

Very different flavoured tea. More savoury- tea flavour more pronounced . Grittier too.

The green vegetable is so nice. Tastes like the Sabah one. 

9-2 every day 

Portion size is crazy big

Thereâ€™s an umami on the soup I cannot place. A creaminess too. Maybe ground nuts ?
