Xmas shopping required a trip to Parkway Parade. 


Hate marine parade. the utensils, the lack of trays. the seating which appears to be reduced. The weird inside cavernous eating area.

Enticed in by the artwork of the stall

Fish soup was peppery
Interesting like fish and chips on the side
Maybe too fried for mine?
tartar sauce

Medium beehoon. Nice tomato slices and shredded cabbage
