Cold rainy days make you yearn for a noodle soup. While cold in Singapore can be subjective, the overcast, gloomy skies, constant drizzle, at least does give off a visual impression of winter. On a recent cycle around the neighbourhood I noticed a new Vietnamese stall appeared to have popped. Vietnamese food has always been one of my favourite styles of cuisine. Due to immigration, there is a lot of very good southern Vietnamese food in Australia. In fact, I consider much of the Australian fare favourably comparable to what you eat in Ho Chi Minh City (*is that considered blasphemy?*). The star of the cuisine, imo, is pho. A soup that somehow feels clean, rich, healthy, and oily all at the same time.

Therefore, I was excited to see pho bo (beef pho) on the menu at Saigon Legend. The stall is run by a Vietnamese guy, which helps me having a picture menu. In fact he offers a variety of vietnamese dishes, from pho to banh mi, to bun cha. I'm not exactly sure how the pricing works as only 3-4 of the items have a price attached.

The place still seems relatively new. I pointed to the pho bo, one of the items that has the price specified. The price of $8.90, for a dish with beef and involves so much cooking time is decent too. Although, I can see how some people might consider it too expensive for a coffee shop meal. In fact I only had $5 on me, luckily this guy had a PayNow option. Be patient for your food too, as he is a one man operation.

When he brought it over to my table, the look and smell of the pho was amazing. I will admit I had a bias, pho is high up on my list of comfort foods. It's more southern style pho that northern, similar to what you would get served in Australia. The first taste of the soup was heavenly, the soup had the depth I was craving. However, but the second and third spoons, the flavour of freshly cracked pepper was overwhelming. Suddenly it was all I could taste. Sadly this wasn't the experience I had in mind.

The sliced raw beef was succulent, impressive for Singapore, where nice lean beef is often very expensive. The dish also had one hand made beef ball (cut in two) that was great. The noodles were melt in your mouth good, nice and silky. My only complaint is that there was so much noodle. Noodle lovers would rejoice, but I couldn't finish them all. The pho was my lunch and I couldn't go back to work in the afternoon in a food coma. I wouldn't have minded a bit of hoisin sauce on the side also, but that's neither here nor there.

I'm going to put my disappointment down to teething issues, there is still a lot to like about this dish, the flavour of soup minus the pepper was great. Anyway it is so refreshing to see some vietnamese flavours served in a coffee shop, I feel I have to support him.
