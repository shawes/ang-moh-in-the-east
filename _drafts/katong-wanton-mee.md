Old school coffee shop. Dare I say it without sounding cliche, but it feels like I have stepped into malaysia. 

Such an old school coffee shop . The sounds of people chatting. The chinking of spoons against coffee cups. The endless chopper thurs as they cut up the chicken rice. To me this is the sound of asia 

Wonderful wanton mee

Sauce is so flavoursome. Can taste the duck fat 

Soup so nice and savoury

Char siew a little dry, but jam packed full of flavour.



$5.00
