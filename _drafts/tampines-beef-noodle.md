I didn't know seremban was famous for beef noodles. 

I used to buy back before marine parade central was renovated. One of the stalls that sadly never reappeared after the year long renovations.

The gravy for these noodles is so thick (calorific?). Its got the consistency of the beef gravy you pour over a roast.

The word gluggy comes ot mind as I mix in the white bee hoon with the sauce.


Chilli is spicy with a sourness (lime?)
Broth looks the part but bland
Love the pickles 
Sesame seeds
