As an ang moh, the odds of getting breast meat when you order chicken rice are extremely high. Probably the same odds of a muslim getting interrogated at western airport. If you don't order for a while, you forget to ask for non-breast meat. I was also not given soup today, slightly unusual and I am sure if I had asked I would have been given it. It was just too hot to complain today.

The chicken is perfectly poached, melting in your mouth. I try and avoid eating too much of the skin, but when its this flavoursome I tell you it takes a lot of willpower. The rice is bursting with chicken stock flavour and each grain is separated â€” an important texture component for me. The chilli sauce is good, nothing exceptional, but it does the job.
