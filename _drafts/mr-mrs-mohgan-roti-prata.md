Now let me start by saying this is a popular stall. As far as I could tell everyone in the kopitiam had ordered from this stall. The ordering process isn't for the faint hearted, she is fierce. You need to know what want before you get to the front of the queue. The menu is written on a white board on the side of a pillar near where she is standing.

I ordered two **prata** kosong. I've always liked my **prata** plain. Maybe egg **prata** if you push me. Mrs Mohgan (behind the cash register) assigned me number 105. Mr Mohgan was on the grill. Looking up to the electronic number monitor it was only up to 91. 27 minutes later my **prata** came.

As the stall suggests, this **prata** is super crispy. Is this what makes it so good? It was tasty, but I prefer my **prata** with a bit more doughiness. Maybe I was just too put off by the long wait and I wasn't in the mood for something so oily.

**Price:** $1.00 per piece of kosong prata  

**Coffee shop:** Tin Yeung Restaurant  
**Address:** 300 Joo Chiat Road  
**Hours:** 6:30am - 1:00pm (closed wednesday)
