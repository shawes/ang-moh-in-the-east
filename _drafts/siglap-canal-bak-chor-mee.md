My wife and I have been coming to this stall off and on for nearly a decade, in fact it could have been the first hawker I ever visited. Back when the coffee shop was under a different operation and EPL was being shown on multiple screens. Mostly for the convincence, more so than the food I will admit. The aunty must have a photographic memory, she always remembers you (and your order), even if it has been months to a year since the last visit. I find this a bit intimidating, especially if I want something else to eat in the coffee shop. The way she says "I haven't seen you around in so long...". I end up ordering out of guilt more than anything.

Once again, like clockwork, she recognised me and waved as I cycled past. But it was a cold rainy day, so why not get a soup? I ordered the bak chor mee soup with mee tai mak. I have eaten the dry but I don't like the brand of mee pok she uses.

I've never encountered a noodle that divides opinion like the humble mee tai mak. It seems like you either love it or you hate it. I fall into the love it camp. 

The sliced pork is cooked to perfection, tender and so so sweet to taste. She is generous with her servings of beansprouts, which I wholeheartedly applaud. The mee tai mak is cooked *al dente*, with a nice bite before than slither down your throat. The eating experience is similar to Katong laksa, whereby the entire bowl can just be eaten with a spoon.

The downside are the fishballs. They are terrible. I just cannot stand them. The flavour is strong but unappealing at best. The texture is rubbery, breaking up on the mouth like you are chewing on an agar based kueh. Next time I will be asking without the fishballs.

But I don't want to dwell on the negatives. The minced meat broth is divine. You couldn't pack much more flavour in there if you tried. The soup is definitely the star.

This back chor mee soup is worth trying for the soup alone. Its even better for breakfast or lunch an overcast rainy day.
