I had to go see a specialist at Parkway East. While I was waiting for my results I was getting hungry. Saw this coffee shop over the road. Not much open, nor many people.

Seems a lot of grab business. Even asked me to grabpay the meal.

Wasn't what I was expecting. I thought a stew was coming out.

Very good value for the money.

Poppadoms were cripsy on the outside but chewy in the middle.

Potato curry was delicious, if spicy. 

Sour, salty, mango pickle was amazing. 

Will definitely come back. 

P.S. Be wary of the drinks stall. Feels like its highway robbery. I paid $1.70 for a coca-cola brand oolong tea, that was warm and came with a cup of ice?Another one of my pet peeves. Sure, a fridge is expensive, but a $1+ profit for all drinks, surely one can be afforded?
