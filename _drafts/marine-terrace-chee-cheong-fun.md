I was introduced to **chee cheong fun** when I was living in Sydney, [yum cha](https://www.broadsheet.com.au/sydney/guides/best-yum-cha) was an almost weekly ritual for my wife and I. That [sydney cantonese style](https://images.app.goo.gl/GncSD8vjZLtq2jAZ9) **chee cheong fun** was more of a thick noodle, wrapping a few prawns and garlic, covered in that signature thin sweet soy & sesame oil sauce. 

The next style I tried was the [penang style](https://images.app.goo.gl/44JbbyKKBquW9RneA) chee cheong fun, where the rice noodle is rolled up, cut into segments and served with almost a hoi son sauce and sesame seeds. 

This chee cheong fun is more like the Sydney style, but still different. The highlight is the rice noodle. It is delicately thin, soft, and silky.
