This is a confusing name for a stall, as there are many variants in the area. Who was this Ah Lim? Turns out there was a lot of competition amongst [fishball noodle sellers](https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/food/mee-pok-war-clone-wars) around the Siglap area and that this stall just piggybacked on the name.

> That leaves the question of the Ah Lim Mee Pok You Mian Kway Teow Mee in Jalan Tua Kong, which replaced Mr Lim's old stall there. When approached, its owners flatly declined to be interviewed but said they had 'no relation' to Mr Lim's stall. But Mr Lim believes the newcomer was recruited by the coffee shop owners to 'mimic my name and style of cooking'. When asked if he approves of the mee pok there, he says he did 'not want to criticise'.

Original or not, it doesn't bother me so much as long as its delicious.

- Slightly expensive

- Chili is spicy. Great prawn flavour. too much tomato ketchup for mine, making it sweet.. Oily, but almost vegetal flavour . Almost overpowering haha 
- Gets you 2 fishballs (nice but not amazing)
- Fish cake . Thin and not so flavoursome 
- Pork . Minced and sliced. Cooked perfectly. Generous amount of mince.
- Soup is delicious
