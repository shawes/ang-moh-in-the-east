Yong tau foo is one of those rare hawker dishes that can actually make the list of "healthy hawker dishes", see [government list](https://www.healthhub.sg/sites/assets/Assets/PDFs/HPB/Food/Intrinsic%20Lower%20Calories%20Food_english_Apr%202018.pdf), [pseudo-government list](https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/food/10-healthier-food-options-at-hawker-centres), and [online list](https://www.womensweekly.com.sg/gallery/beauty-and-health/the-healthiest-local-foods-you-can-order-in-singapore-hawker-centres/). Obviously this is dependent on what you pick and choose. However, even if you pick all fried ingredients, you still feel like you can pat yourself on the back for choosing yong tau foo over hokkien mee for lunch.

My biggest problem with YTF is that I always over order. I cannot seem to understand how much is required to make me feel full. You would think by now I would have a better understanding, but seems not. Once again I over ordered, choosing a mix of fried bean curd things and vegetables packed full of fish paste. To be honest I never know what half the things are in the YTF selection, I try and ask about some, but I always feel the aunty or uncle becoming impatient with all my questions.

I ordered mine in the clear soup with kway teow mee. The soup was delicious and clean. Felt very healthy. I was worried I would regret not choosing the laksa version, but no, this soup was satisfying. All the ingredients were decent, without being wow amazing. I dipped a lot in the sweet sauce so probably couldn't appreciate the flavour as much. Great value for money and I felt like I lowered my blood pressure through a meal.

**Price:** $5.30
