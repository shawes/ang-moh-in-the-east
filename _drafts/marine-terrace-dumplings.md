You can't expect the din tai fung finesse from hawker stall dumplings. If you go in with that mindset, you will always be disappointed. The skin on these dumplings is good, fairly thin. Often the biggest weaknesses is the clagginess of the skins. These dumplings had little clag. 

The inside was a generous mix of high quality pork mince and green vegetable. The juice from the fat of the dumplings oozed out upon bite. 

I don't understand how to use a dipping sauce of black vinegar filled to the brim with juliend ginger. 

Appears to be homemade chilli oil.
