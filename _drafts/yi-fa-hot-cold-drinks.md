The craft beer scene is currently exploding in Singapore. You are able to taste delicious ranges of brews at [cool bars](https://www.facebook.com/DruggistsSG/), [stalls](https://www.facebook.com/smithstreettaps) in hawker centres, to local [microbreweries](http://pinkblossomsbrewing.com). In following this trend, it is refreshing to now see drink stalls in hawkers centres that offer more than the usual asia pacific or carlsberg choices.

Uncle Allen has been well ahead of the trend, offering a wide variety of been by the bottle for several years. The offerings change depending on suppliers, but there are styles ranging from American IPAs, to German wheat beers, to Somerset ciders.

Although his specialty is the *snow beer*, not the [tasteless beer from China](https://www.ratebeer.com/beer/snow-beer/39394/), but he freezes the beer and the glass to create a truly refreshing cold beer. The snow comes from water content within the beer that freezes, creating the appearance of a snow dome. There is nothing better on a hot singapore weekend afternoon.
