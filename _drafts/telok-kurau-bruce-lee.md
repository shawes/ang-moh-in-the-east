Rice is amazing
Free achar - put as much as you want. Although the jar was nearly empty when I was there.

Price seems expensive initially, but it comes with a generous amount of.. well everything.

Comes with egg
the skin is crispy
Beansprouts like I'm in Ipoh.
Crispy fried garlic sprinkled on top
Soup was almost western styl chicken soup with celery nd carrot. hearty.

**Price:** $6.00

**Address:** XXX Smith St, Smithsville  
**Hours:** XXam - XXpm (closed xx)
