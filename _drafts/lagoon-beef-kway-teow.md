The appearance of the sign makes this look like a veteran hawker stall. 



Salty savoury chilli - too salty in fact. Grated galangal? 
Slurpy melt in mouth kway teow.
Nice beef, make a little over cooked. 
Crunchy bean sprouts. 
The star of the show is the broth.
Shredded pickled veg.

Very nice and clean. Rare for hawker food.
