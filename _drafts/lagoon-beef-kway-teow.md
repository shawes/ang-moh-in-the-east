I was drawn by the appearance of the sign, making it look like a veteran hawker stall. Original design.

You don't see beef served too much. The older generation don't seem to like the smell of beef and the younger generation seem to think steak is the be all and end all.

I get intimidated by stalls with no picture or even written menus. First I worry if the stall holder speaks english, because my hokkien and malay are pretty limited. Second, I like to know what my options are? The only menu I can see on this stall is the price. $5 or $7. I can only assume that gets you more or less.

The chilli seems to have grated galangal, aka blue ginger, in it? It produces an intense savoury flavour with too much salt added. I found it overpowered the flavour of the beef, which is what I want from this dish. 

Salty savoury chilli - too salty in fact. Grated galangal?
Slurpy melt in mouth kway teow.
Nice beef, make a little over cooked.
Crunchy bean sprouts.
The star of the show is the broth.
Shredded pickled veg.


Very nice and clean. Rare for hawker food.
