It was a rainy day and I found myself in Bedok (doing a carousell exchange). I felt like something soupy and as I walked into the Bedok Interchange hawker centre Inspirasi caught my eye. Specifically, the $2.50 price for soto ayam. How could I resist trying? I walked up and ordered a bowl and added a begedil, which was served in haste. I glanced back behind me and I took my bowl and suddenly there were 20 people queuing. I did not realise how popular this stall was, I just lucked out today I suppose.

The first thing I ate was the begedil. I cannot resist these little fried pockets of spiced potato and this one didn't let me down. So good.

The soup itself is delicious. Not too oily, not too salty, not too grainy, just a moreish chicken and tumeric flavour.

The rice cakes taste so fresh, almost creamy in texture, and they feel lower in calories than noodles, even if that's not the case. Mind over matter. The chicken is tender, melting in your mouth, even if there is not a lot of it. The beansprouts are crunchy, which is how I prefer them to be, adding texture to the dish.

The bowl was so good I finished all of the soup. Definitely a stall worth checking out for some great malay food.
