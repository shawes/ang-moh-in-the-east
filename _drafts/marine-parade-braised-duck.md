Reluctantly, I found myself back at marine parade food centre and hungry. For reasons I have stated, its the worst food centre in the east. A place I go to eat only when necessary. To offset this, I thought I should try something popular amongst the people, food which might make me feel more positive about this place. So contrary to my instincts, I walked a lap and chose the stall with the longest queue. Today this happened to be *Kun Ji Duck Rice*.

Now while I hate queues, I do greatly appreciate stalls that increase productivty to reduce waiting times. Kun Ji has got this down to an art form - the key is to keep people moving and not standing around too long. Multiple people working at the stall all had their defined roles. The queue moved briskly. In fact, faster than I expected, forcing me to make up my mind before I was even ready. As it was the first time at this store I went with the first dish on the banner, braised duck rice. To make justify the queuing, I added some braised tau pok into the mix.

First off, the portion size was generous, a rare commodity this day and age. The duck itself was tender and juicy. Duck has always been my favourite meat. Sadly, I wasn't sold on the braising sauce, which was a little bland for my palate. I would have preferred some stronger flavours and more salt.

The grains of rice seemed to have been broken up, either that or it was a different variety of rice than normal. The smaller grains soaked up so much of the braising sauce, it was a stroke of genius (I wish I liked the sauce more!). The tau pok was also decent. But then tau pok is hard to stuff up. The other star of the dish was the soup. Duck flavoured broth. What could go wrong.

Would I queue up for this again? I think it would depend on the size of the queue. Maybe next time I just ask for more of the duck.

**Price:** $4.00 ($3.50 for braised duck rice + 50c for tau pok)  

**Hawker centre:** Marine Parade Food Centre  
**Address:** 84 Marine Parade Central  
**Hours:** 9.30am - 10pm (or sold out)
