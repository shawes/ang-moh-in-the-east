I had read about this stall because of the burgeoning [TikTok career of the owner](https://mothership.sg/2020/02/tiktok-katong-chicken-rice-soki-wu/). So when I found myself in Katong Shopping Centre for an unrelated errand, I decided to give the chicken rice a go. First of all it wasn't super easy to find, navigating weirdly placed escalators, the basement eatery is at the far end of the shopping centre its â€” the haig rd end.

The ordering system is unique. You can use this electronic system at the entrance of the eatery to order and pay for your chicken rice. You select from the menu and get given a number. This shows how popular this place must get during peak eating hours. When your order if ready, you go and collect it from a large stainless steel table positioned in front of the chicken rice stall. The chicken rice is obviously the dominant stall here.

We ordered essentially the 2 person feed of the boneless roasted chicken rice for $13.80. The portions we got were huge and the presentation was amazing. A mountain of chicken on top of what seemed like 2 or 3 cucumbers slice up. It came with large servings of the chicken rice and we each got a soup that appeared to have half a cabbage in it.

The chicken was the joy, so juicy and tender. It was doused in a sweet sauce, not unlike the one used for cantonese style chee cheong fun. The chili sauce was power and with just the right amount of garlic flavour. The rice was delicious, not too oily, but maybe a little dry. The soup was amazing, complex but clean at the same time. Was a great way to finish off the meal.

While it was a bit more on the expensive side, the quality and portion of the ingredients make up for it in a big way.

**Price:** $13.80 (2 portions of roasted boneless chicken rice)  

**Coffee shop:** Katong Shopping Centre (Basement eatery, near Haig Rd end)  
**Address:** 865 Mountbatten Rd, 437844
