Huge portions
Wonderful complex chicken soup . Not oily . Biggest side soup I have ever gotten. Seemed like half a cabbage.  
Wonderful presentation . Fried garlic.
Chili sauce is strong with garlic. Spicy
Chicken was so juicy. So tender.
The sweet sauce worked beautifully with the chicken. - almost Chee Cheong fun.
Almost a bed of fresh cucumber
Rice was nice. Not too oily or salty. Maybe a little dry.

**Price:** $13.80 (2 portions of roasted boneless chicken rice)
