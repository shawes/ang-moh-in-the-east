Not the most original name for a wanton mee stall. I believe when it first opened it was attached to the tanjong rhu brand or gave the impression it was at least.

Wanton mee is another one of those hawker foods that is considered lower in calories. Although I asked for chilli and black sauce. I like the sweet, salty, and spicy combination. I think that might ruin the calorie count. The portion size here is small, but I prefer that for a lunch. You don't want to be processing a stomach full of carbs back at your desk.

The sauce is decent and costs the noodles nicely. There is nothing worse when there is more noodles than sauce and you can't cover them all in the flavour, staring at those yellow sections knowing it will just taste of wheat. The noodles were thinner than the type I prefer, but they had a nice springiness. I don't normally like the deep fried wantons, but this one actually had a decent amount of meat inside. the char siew didn't look that appealing I must say, but it was not as dry as it looked and had ample flavour, if a bit sweet. The soup came with two nice wantons, but the soup itself was not spectacular.
