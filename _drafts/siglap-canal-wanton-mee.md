Not the most original name.

Also always in the low calories lists



Fried wanton actually has a lot of meat in it . 

$3.50 … 3.5 stars

Got chilli and black sauce

noodles thinner than my favourite. But very nice 

The meat didn’t look much but was quite juicy and flavoursome, if a bit sweet

Small serving (I orders the small) but it’s nice amount for lunch

2 wantons in the soup. Soup is nice. Not spectacular 



**Price:** $X.XX  

**Coffee shop:** The food emporium
**Address:** XXX Smith St, Smithsville  
**Hours:** XXam - XXpm (closed xx)
