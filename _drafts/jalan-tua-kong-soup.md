The soup is amazing. My first time trying.

[roasted chicken noodle]({% post_url 2021-04-28-jalan-tua-kong-chicken-noodle %})

Nice flavour of the tomato. Salty goodness. 

The vegetable is salty, but not overly so. There is a nice sourness, but the tomato adds a sweetness to the soup also. 

So much herbal flavour in the soup. Tonic for the soul. The duck was a bit dry if anything.
