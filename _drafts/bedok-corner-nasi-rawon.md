Buah kelauk sauce is delicious .

Beef is melt in mouth apart, but obviously not the best cuts

Sotong is not as spicy as it looks

Beef lung is like biltong 

The begedil is uniquely flavoured 

The chilli sauce was too hot for me 

**Price:** $7.00  

**Hawker centre:** The food emporium
**Address:** XXX Smith St, Smithsville  
**Hours:** XXam - XXpm (closed xx)
