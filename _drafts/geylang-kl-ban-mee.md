I noticed this stall tucked away in the corner of a coffee shop as I was headed towards the [SSVP shop](https://ssvpsingapore.org/ssvp-shop/) on geylang rd for some thrift shopping. I am assuming the KL traditional chilli ban mee stands for 'Kuala Lumpur', but with the comic sans font it is hard to assume anything. I have only eaten ban mee in KL once from a roadside stall and all I can really remember was that it was spicy. This stall lets you choose your own spice levels, from 1-5, so perhaps it is authentic?? I ordered the signature chilli ban mee with spice level 3.

The bowl of ban mee is served with an egg with a runny yolk, just how I like it. I mix the runny yolk goodness in with all the noodles. The noodles are amazing. Thick and chewy like udon noodles, with a really satisfying mouthfeel as you chew on them. The pork balls feel homemade, or at least boutique factory made, with a nice meaty texture and well balanced flavour. The dish is topped off with fried garlic and probably the finest minced prok I have ever seen. What's not too like?
