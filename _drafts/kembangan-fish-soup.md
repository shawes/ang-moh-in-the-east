The initial experience was confusing. 
$7.50 for fish soup with noodles. I was very confused with how all the pricing worked.

Did get exactly what I ordered.

Soup is spicy with assam tang.

Fish is very nice - sea bass
A lot of pieces of fish
Tomato tang c

Mis com ordered the fried fish
Got the chili lime soup.
