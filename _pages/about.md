<p>First, a little bit about me. I'm a 30-something Australian who has recently found themselves living on the east coast of Singapore, seemingly halfway between Changi and the city. I love food and working from home has allowed me to visit many coffee shops and hawkers around the east to experience the local dishes Singapore has to offer. While I miss my local cuisine, especially the humble chiko roll, I'm relishing the food adventure that is Singapore.</p>
