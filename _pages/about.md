<p>Hello, I'm a 30-something Australian who has recently found themselves living on the east coast of Singapore, somewhere halfway between Changi and the city. I get a lot of enjoyment from eating (you could tell by the size of me), and working from home has allowed me to visit many coffee shops and hawkers around the east to experience the local dishes Singapore has to offer. While I miss the food in Australia, especially the humble chiko roll, I'm loving being on this food adventure in Singapore and expanding my horizons. Hopefully I can capture the breadth of what food in the east coast is all about - show it is more than just Katong laksa...</p>
