<p>Hello, I'm Steve, a 30-something Australian who has recently found themselves living on the east coast of Singapore, somewhere halfway between Changi and the city. I get a lot of enjoyment from eating (you could tell by the size of me), and working from home has allowed me to visit many coffee shops and hawkers around the east to experience the local dishes Singapore has to offer. While I miss my local cuisine, especially the humble chiko roll, I'm loving being on this food adventure in Singapore and expanding my horizons.</p>

Why another food related blog in Singapore you may ask? It's a fair question. After wanting to learn about hawker food in the east to try, I found that there is a lack of originality in the stalls chosen and I wanted to try and capture the breadth of what food in the east is all about - it is a lot more than just Katong laksa...
